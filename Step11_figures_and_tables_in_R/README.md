# Step 11: generate figures and tables in R

## oCGI and peak overlap in single species:
Figure 1, Figures S3-S9  

Fig1_CGIcentric.R  
&emsp;&emsp;Generates Figure 1A-B; Figure S3  

Fig1_peakCentric.R  
&emsp;&emsp;Generates Figure 1C-E; Figures S4-9  

## Orthologous oCGIs across species pairs:
Figure 2, Figures S11-16  

Fig2_orthologous_oCGIs.R  
&emsp;&emsp;Generates Figure 2B; Figure S11; Table S2  

Fig2_speciesComparisons.R  
&emsp;&emsp;Generates Figure 2C-E; Figure S12-16  

Fig3_rhesusMouse_example.R  
&emsp;&emsp;Generates example grid and histogram in Figure S17  

Fig3-4_grids.R  
&emsp;&emsp;Generates Figure 3C-D, 4A, 7B-C; Figure S18-23, S27, S39  

Fig3_peakStatComparisons.R  
&emsp;&emsp;Generates Figure 3E; Figures S24-25
