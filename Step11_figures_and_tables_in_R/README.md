# Step 11: generate figures and tables in R

## oCGI and peak overlap in single species:
Figure 1, Figures S3-S9  

Fig1_CGIcentric.R  
&emsp;&emsp;Generates Figure 1A-B, Figure S3  

Fig1_peakCentric.R  
&emsp;&emsp;Generates Figure 1C-E, Figures S4-9  

Fig2_orthologous_oCGIs.R
&emsp;&emsp;Generates Figure 2B, Figure S11, Table S2

Fig2_speciesComparisons.R
&emsp;&emsp;Generates Figure 2C-E, Figure S12-16

Fig3-4_grids.R 
## Generate heatmap grids in Fig 3 & 4

Fig3_rhesusMouse_example.R
## Generate numbers and histogram for example in Fig S3.1

Fig3_peakStatComparisons.R
## Comparisons of peak strength, phastCons, age, etc
