Each directory contains:  
&emsp;&emsp;README.md file explaining its contents  
&emsp;&emsp;Workflow files (ending .sh) for manipulating functional genomic files and running jobs from the command line  
&emsp;&emsp;Python scripts (ending .py) and R scripts (ending .R) required for steps of the analysis, called within .sh files  
&emsp;&emsp;R scripts that generate figures and tables (see Step11)
